\section{RPC on hydrogen}

Has been measured in \cite{RPC_1972_Bistirlich_PhysRevC.5.1867}.

Events of interest for calibration are the monochomatic RPC photons at 129.4 MeV from $\pi^{-} p \to n \gamma$ on
hydrogen. Measurement of this process is shown in 
Figure~\ref{figure:1971_bistirlich_fig_02_h2}
, the photon energy spectrum from pion capture on hydrogen, which also includes lower energy photons from the charge exchange reaction. 
For the $\rm{CH_2}$ spectrum in 
Figure~\ref{figure:1971_bistirlich_fig_09_ch2}
, photons from RPC on carbon occupy the region between the two hydrogen peaks.
To produce a photon in the 129.4 MeV peak, a negative pion stopped on
a $\rm{CH_2}$  degrader must both (i) capture on a hydrogen rather than carbon nucleus, and (ii) interact
radiatively with the proton via $\pi^{-} p \to n \gamma$ rather than producing an intermediate $\pi^0$.

The probability of pion capture on the hydrogen component of the $\rm{CH_2}$ compound is
$\newline \rm{ W_H = (12.9 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-3 }}$
 as used in Ref.~\cite{RPC_1991_Harston_PhysRevA.44.103}
 , an average of previous measurements. 
 This accounts for both hydrogen atoms in the $\rm{CH_2}$ molecule, and is larger than but consistent with the
 corresponding measurement (expressed as percent) in Ref.~\cite{RPC_1972_Bistirlich_PhysRevC.5.1867}.
 Negative pions captured on hydrogen have a $ (41.4 \pm 3.2) \% $
 probability of interacting via $\pi^{-} p \to n \gamma$ and producing a photon at 129.4 MeV
 \cite{RPC_1972_Bistirlich_PhysRevC.5.1867}.
 The remaining pions captured on hydrogen produce two photons via the charge exchange reaction
 $ \pi^{-} p \to n \pi^0 $ with $\pi^0  \to \gamma \gamma $,
 which results in the lower energy peak of the hydrogen spectrum. 

Together these factors yield a probability of around $ 5 \times 10^{-3} $
for obtaining 129.4 MeV RPC photons from pion capture on $\rm{CH_2}$.
