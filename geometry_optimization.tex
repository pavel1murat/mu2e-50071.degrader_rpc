\section{Degrader geometry}

The pion degrader was initially introduced in order to suppress the background to \piplusenu\
from muon decays in flight. The degrader is a movable disk made of non-magnetic material,
which gets inserted into the beam during the calibration runs and moved out of the beam
during the regular data taking.

  }
\end{figure}

The simulated degrader geometry is schematically shown in Figure~\ref{figure:degrader_geometry_001}.
A gold converter ring has the outer radius $R_{out}$ = 250mm, and the value of $R_{in}$ is defined
by the converter thickness. The converter is slightly offset downstream wit respect to the $CH_2$ disk,
so $e*+$ and $e^-$ produced in the converter do not cross it multiple times.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  From \piplusenu\ studies: the pion degrader disk thickness of 4 mm Ti is close to optimal.
\item
  4mm of Ti translates into the total amount of material of $\sim 1.8 g/cm^2$,
  about twice the material of the stopping target.
\item
  9mm CH2 + 1.0mm Pb: : 2.0 $g/cm^2$   .. $\pi*15^2*(0.9*0.95 + 0.08*11.34): \simeq 2 g/cm^2$
\item
   9mm CH2 + 0.8mm Pb: : $1.76 g/cm^2$
 \item
   CH2 disk R=14 cm, weight        : $0.90*0.95*\pi*14^2 ~= 526$ gr \\
   Pb  foil R=10cm thickness 0.8mm : $0.08*11.34*\pi*10^2 = 285$ gr \\
   total                           : 811 gr
\end{itemize}

To make sure that $e^+$ and $e^-$ do not cross the converter foil multiple times,
the converter is moved downstream by 1cm with respect to the degrader disk.

The converter foil could be supported by a carbon foam disk surrounding the degrader.
A potentially more attractive alternative could be to have the converter placed
on a thin carbon foam ring and supported from the OPA. 
As the $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ acceptance is proportional to the width of the converter ring,
making it, for example, 3cm wide instead of 1 cm wide would increase the acceptance
by a factor close to x3.

This option is discussed in Section~\ref{section:geometry_v4}

\subsection{Stopped negative pions}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Simulation of the negative pion beam follows the standard 2-stage model.
  Stage 2 produces three separate datasets of pions stops in the CH2, Pb, and the ST.
  The scheme allow to resimulate the pion stop datasets w/o repeating more time consuming
  first stage of the simulation.
\item
  To improve the simulation efficiency pion decays are disabled. The calculated by Geant4
  pion survival probabilities are used as event weights in the normalization procedure.
\end{itemize}

Distributions of momentum and time for pions stopped in it CH2, Pb foil, and the
stopping target are shown in Figure \ref{figure:stopped_pim_mom_time}.

  \end{tikzpicture}

    Stopped pions: distributions of momentum and time
  }
\end{figure}

It is worth noting that pions stopped in the $CH_2$ are the slowest ones.
Therefore, selecting events with the pion stop time above certain threshold, i.e. $\sim 200$ ns, 
significantly suppresses contributions of the stopping target and the Pb foil to any measurement.
T0 = 200 ns is also approximately the time where the instantaneous beam flash
hit rate gets reduced down to the level allowing the measurements. For the DAQ operations,
that means that the digitization start time should be lowered to $\sim 250$ ns,
which, at a reduced proton beam intensity, looks quite realistic.

Another interesting correlation is the correlation between the pion momentum on exit from the TS momentum
and the vertical coordinate of the pion stop point. Figure ~\ref{figure:y_vs_p_deg} shows this correlation
for pions stopped in the $CH_2$ and Pb parts of the degrader. The Y distribution of the pion stops
in the Pb foil is offset down by several centimeters. The lower cut-off at R=100 mm is determined by the
by the simulated radius of the Pb foil, R=100mm

Y:X distributions of the pion stops in the $CH_2$ disk, Pb foil and the ST are shown in Figure ~\ref{figure:y_vs_x_st}.
They reflect the correlation between the mean Y of the particle trajectory and the particle momentum.
