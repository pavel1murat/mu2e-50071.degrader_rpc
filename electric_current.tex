\section{Electric current}
When inserted into the beam, the degrader stops the beam particles, which are
mostly low energy, MeV-range, electrons. To avoid the accumulation of the electric charge,
the degrader needs to be grounded. An estimate of the electric current can be obtained
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  assume that degrader stops all beam flash particles
\item
  from SU2020: the rate of the beam flash particles, assume all are electrons, is $\sim ~ 10^2$ of that of muons
\item
  muons : $1.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \times 3.9 \cdot 10^7$ , say, $7 \cdot 10^4$.
  That gives $\sim ~ 7 \cdot 10^7$ electrons per 1.7 ms
\item
  the corresponding electric current is $I ~=~ 7 \cdot 10^{-7} \times 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} / {1.7 \cdot 10^{-6}} \sim 7 \cdot 10^{-6}$ A,
  or $\sim$ 10 microamperes
\end{itemize}
