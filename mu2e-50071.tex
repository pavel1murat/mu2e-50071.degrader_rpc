    Radiative pion capture (RPC) on hydrogen  provides a unique opportunity to calibrate
    the Mu2e momentum scale at full field.

    Kinematic edge of the momentum distribution of 129.4 MeV RPC photons
    reconstructed in $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ channel could be used as a calibration line.

    We investigate whether the rate of events of interest is sufficient for the calibration.

\section {Introduction}
Negative pions stopped in hydrogen get captured by the hydrogen atoms, 
with the following interactions proceeding via two main channels:
$\pi^- p \to n\pi^0$ and $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$.

The second channel has a branching ratio close to 40\% and it produces monochromatic
photons with the energy E=129.4 MeV~\cite{something_on_RPC}.

The 129.4 MeV peak from $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$ is also clearly visible on hydrogen-containing
compounds, see for example \cite{}.

Using such a compound, for example polyethylene, as a material for the Mu2e pion degrader
disk may allow using the 129.4 MeV photons for calibrating the detector momentum scale.

Calibration requires one additional element - a this converter ring located next to the degrader
at a sufficiently large radius, of the order of R $\sim$ 25 cm. Photons converted there would
produce a $e^+e^-$ pair, with both an electron and a positron producing sufficient number of
the tracker hits for both tracks to be reconstructed. 
The converted photon energy can be then determined as the sum of the two reconstructed
track momenta, $E = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$ 

All momentum scale calibration approaches discussed so far assume that the magnetic field
in the detector solenoid is reduced \cite{MU2E_48630_PIPLUSENU}.
The calibration discussed in this note can be performed in the nominal magnetic field.

\section{Electric current}
When inserted into the beam, the degrader stops the beam particles, which are
mostly low energy, MeV-range, electrons. To avoid the accumulation of the electric charge,
the degrader needs to be grounded. An estimate of the electric current can be obtained
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  assume that degrader stops all beam flash particles
\item
  from SU2020: the rate of the beam flash particles, assume all are electrons, is $\sim ~ 10^2$ of that of muons
\item
  muons : $1.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \times 3.9 \cdot 10^7$ , say, $7 \cdot 10^4$, which gives $\sim ~ 7 \cdot 10^7$ electrons per 1.7 ms
\item
  the corresponding electric current is $I ~=~ 7 \cdot 10^{-7} \times 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} / {1.7 \cdot 10^{-6}} \sim 7 \cdot 10^{-6}$ A,
  or $\sim$ 10 microamperes
\end{itemize}

\section {Summary}

With small modifications, the pion degrader becomes an instrument to calibrate the Mu2e
momentum scale in full field.
