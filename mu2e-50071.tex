  \begin{abstract}
    \vspace{0.2in}
    Radiative pion capture (RPC) on hydrogen  provides a unique opportunity to calibrate
    the Mu2e momentum scale at full field.

    Kinematic edge of the momentum distribution of 129.4 MeV RPC photons
    reconstructed in $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ channel could be used as a calibration line.

    We investigate whether the rate of events of interest is sufficient for the calibration.
