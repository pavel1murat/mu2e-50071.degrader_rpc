    The pion degrader reduces the background from muon decays in flight to facilitate
    the momentum scale calibration with \piplusenu\ decays. That calibration needs to
    be performed at $B \simeq 0.7$ T, so the determined momentum scale would need to be
    extrapolated to the nominal field value, B = 1 T.
    
    With small modifications, the pion degrader could become an instrument
    also allowing to calibrate the Mu2e momentum scale in full field.
    The calibration at full field is based on reconstruction of a 129.4 MeV photon
    peak from RPC on hydrogen, $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$.
%
    The converted photon energy is given by the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass,
    This note demonstrates that due to relatively small multiple scattering,
    the sum of the electron an positron momenta gives a good approximation
    of the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass. Thus reconstruction of the energy of a photon
    converted several meters in upstream of the tracker only needs the $e^+$ and $e^-$
    track momenta to be reconstructed, but doesn't require the track extrapolation
    back to the degrader.

    Under realistic assumptions, the time needed to calibrate the momentum scale
    to the accuracy better then 100 keV while running at 10\% of the nominal proton beam
    intensity is about one day.

\section {Introduction}
Negative pions stopped in hydrogen get captured by the hydrogen atoms, 
with the following interactions proceeding via two main channels:
$\pi^- p \to n\pi^0$ and $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$.

The second channel has a branching ratio close to 40\% and as both initial state particles
are at rest, the outgoing photons are monochromatic with the energy E=129.4 MeV~\cite{something_on_RPC}.

The 129.4 MeV peak from $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$ is also clearly visible on hydrogen-containing
compounds, for example, polyethylene \cite{}.

Using such a compound as a material for the Mu2e pion degrader disk may allow to calibrate
the Mu2e momentum scale at B = 1 T.

The scale calibration requires one additional element - a this converter ring located next
to the degrader at a sufficiently large radius, of the order of R $\sim$ 25 cm.
Photons converted there would produce a $e^+e^-$ pair, with both an electron and
a positron producing sufficient number of the tracker hits for both tracks
to be reconstructed. The converted photon energy can be then determined as the sum
of the two reconstructed track momenta, $E = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$ 
All momentum scale calibration approaches discussed so far assume that the magnetic field
in the detector solenoid is reduced \cite{MU2E_48630_PIPLUSENU}.
An advantage of the calibration discussed in this note is that it can be performed
without reducing the DS magnetic field.

\section{Electric current}
When inserted into the beam, the degrader stops the beam particles, which are
mostly low energy, MeV-range, electrons. To avoid the accumulation of the electric charge,
the degrader needs to be grounded. An estimate of the electric current can be obtained
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  assume that degrader stops all beam flash particles
\item
  from SU2020: the rate of the beam flash particles, assume all are electrons, is $\sim ~ 10^2$ of that of muons
\item
  muons : $1.6 \cdot 10^{-3} \times 3.9 \cdot 10^7$ , say, $7 \cdot 10^4$, which gives $\sim ~ 7 \cdot 10^7$ electrons per 1.7 ms
\item
  the corresponding electric current is $I ~=~ 7 \cdot 10^{-7} \times 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} / {1.7 \cdot 10^{-6}} \sim 7 \cdot 10^{-6}$ A,
  or $\sim$ 10 microamperes
\end{itemize}

\section {Summary}

The pion degrader reduces the background from muon decays in flight to facilitate
the momentum scale calibration with \piplusenu\ decays. That calibration needs to
be performed at $B \simeq 0.7$ T, so the determined momentum scale would need to be
extrapolated to the nominal field value, B = 1 T.

With small modifications, the pion degrader could become an instrument
for calibrating the Mu2e momentum scale in full field. This calibration is based on
reconstruction of a 129.4 MeV photon peak in the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass spectrum.
%
This note demonstrates that due to small multiple scattering the sum of the
electron an positron momenta gives a good approximation of the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass.

Under realistic assumptions, the time needed to calibrate the momentum scale
to the accuracy better then 100 keV while running at 10\% of the nominal proton beam
intensity is about one day.
