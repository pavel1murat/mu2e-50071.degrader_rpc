    The pion degrader reduces the background from muon decays in flight to facilitate
    the momentum scale calibration with \piplusenu\ decays. The calibration needs to
    be performed at $B \simeq 0.7$ T, so the determined momentum scale would need to be
    extrapolated to the nominal field value, B = 1.0 T.
    
    With small modifications, the degrader could also become a tool for
    calibrating the Mu2e momentum scale at full field, B = 1.0 T.
    The calibration at full field is based on a reconstruction of a 129.4 MeV
    photon peak from RPC on hydrogen, $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$. Photons converted
    on in thin converter foil are reconstructed in the $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ channel.
%
    Due to relatively small multiple scattering, a scalar sum of the reconstructed
    momenta of \eplus\ and \eminus\ tracks gives a good approximation of the converted
    photon energy.
    %
    Therefore, the reconstruction of the energy of a photon converted several meters
    upstream of the tracker doesn't require the track extrapolation back to the
    conversion point.

    The estimated time needed to calibrate the momentum scale to the accuracy better
    then 100 keV while running at 10\% of the nominal proton beam intensity
    is about one day.

\section {Introduction}
Negative pions stopped in hydrogen get captured by the hydrogen atoms, 
with the following interactions proceeding via two main channels:
$\pi^- p \to n\pi^0$ and $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$.

The $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$ channel has the branching ratio close to 40\%
and as in case of a stopped $\pi^-$ both initial state particles are at rest,
the outgoing photons are monochromatic with the energy E=129.4 MeV~\cite{RPC_1972_Bistirlich_PhysRevC.5.1867}.

The 129.4 MeV peak from $\pi^- p \to n \gamma$ is also clearly visible on hydrogen-containing
compounds, for example, polyethylene \cite{RPC_1972_Bistirlich_PhysRevC.5.1867}.

Using such a compound as a material for the Mu2e pion degrader disk may allow to calibrate
the Mu2e momentum scale at B = 1 T.

The scale calibration requires one additional element - a thin converter ring
of a sufficiently large radius and located next to the degrader in Z.
If the radius of the conversion point is large enough, i.e. of the order of 25-30 cm,
both \eplus\ and \eminus\ from a photon conversion could produce sufficient
number of hits in the tracker to have their tracks reconstructed.
The converted photon energy can be then determined as the scalar sum
of the two reconstructed track momenta, $E = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$

Approaches to the momentum scale calibration discussed so far rely either on the measurement
of the edge of Michel spectrum (~52 \MeVc) or measurement of the positron peak from
\piplusenu\ decay ($\sim$ 70 \MeVc) and therefore need to be performed with the reduced
DS magnetic field \cite{MU2E_48630_PIPLUSENU}.
An advantage of the calibration discussed in this note is that it can be performed
at B = 1.0 T, without reducing the DS magnetic field.

\section {Summary}

The pion degrader reduces the background from muon decays in flight to facilitate
the momentum scale calibration with \piplusenu\ decays. That calibration needs to
be performed at $B \simeq 0.7$ T, so the determined momentum scale would need to be
extrapolated to the nominal field value, B = 1 T.

With small modifications, the pion degrader could become an instrument
for calibrating the Mu2e momentum scale in full field. This calibration is based on
reconstruction of a 129.4 MeV photon peak in the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass spectrum.
%
This note demonstrates that due to small multiple scattering the sum of the
electron an positron momenta gives a good approximation of the $e^+e^-$ invariant mass.

Under realistic assumptions, the time needed to calibrate the momentum scale
to the accuracy better then 100 keV while running at 10\% of the nominal proton beam
intensity is about one day.
