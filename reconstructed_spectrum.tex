\section{Reconstructed photon spectrum}

For the photon energy of $\sim$ 130 MeV, the present reconstruction code is not expected
to reconstruct $\gamma \to e^+e^-$ events efficiently.

{\red run reconstruction and demonstrate that ? }

However, the intrinsic resolution of the tracker should contribute less than 0.5 MeV to the
reconstructed full width of the $e^+e^-$ conversion peak.

We therefore use the MC truth - the sum of the two MC particle momenta recorded in front
of the tracker - as a proxy to the reconstructed photon momentum
